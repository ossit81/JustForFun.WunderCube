This is a solution for Wundercube game (http://www.wunderdog.fi/wunderkuutio). 

Start application from command line with following command:

C:\<your application folder>\JustForFun.WunderCube.exe

Application will read from the same folder 'cube.txt' file and the 'words.txt' file. The files can be found from Wunderdog website: http://www.wunderdog.fi/s/cube.txt, http://www.wunderdog.fi/s/words.txt or from solution folder ..\JustForFun.WunderCube\Data\cube.txt and ..\JustForFun.WunderCube\Data\words.txt. 

The list of found words can be found from output file 'results.txt' after the application has been executed successfully.

Enjoy.
